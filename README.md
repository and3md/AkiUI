### Experimental UI library for Pascal based on GTK

An attempt to check if it is possible to create a new and easier approach to user interfaces in Pascal by abandoning the VCL (LCL) baggage.

Assumptions:
* (almost) one file API 
* using GTK3 (GTK4 in the future) as backend

Currently it's just an experiment, don't use it for real projects.
